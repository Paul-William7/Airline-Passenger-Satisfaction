# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores and analyzes factors influencing passenger satisfaction in air travel using real-world airline data. The analysis provides insights into trends, service quality, and elements affecting traveler satisfaction across different demographics and flight types.

## 📌 Objective

- Understand passenger trends, flight distances, and delays.
- Analyze satisfaction levels by travel type, flight class, and passenger category.
- Identify key drivers of satisfaction such as punctuality, comfort, food, and Wi-Fi.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to prepare the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovered patterns in passenger types, service ratings, and satisfaction outcomes.
- Visualizations provided comparisons across business vs. economy class, travel type, and delay impact.

## 📁 Dataset

- `airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv`: Main dataset used for analysis.
- `data_dictionary.csv`: Reference file containing definitions and descriptions of dataset columns.

> Ensure both files are in the same directory as the notebook before running it.

## 📚 Reference Data

- `data_dictionary.csv`: A supplementary file that defines column names, categories, and terms used in the main dataset. Helpful for understanding the context and variables used in the analysis.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Place the dataset CSV in the same directory.
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
